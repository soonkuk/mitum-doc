# Comparison With POS and DPOS

## Known Problem

### POS: Nothing At Stake

The major criticism for POS is *Nothing At Stake* problem[^1]. You can easily find what *Nothing At Stake* problem is at [Understanding Proof of Stake: The Nothing at Stake Theory](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-proof-of-stake-the-nothing-at-stake-theory-1f0d71bc027).

Despite POS and DPOS, ISAAC+ and even another *PBFT* consensus protocols does not suffer this problem, because there is no blocks branch in PBFT and it's siblings.
