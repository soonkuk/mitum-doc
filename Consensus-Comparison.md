## FLP Theorem

> The Fischer Lynch Paterson impossibility result ([FLP](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf)) states that a deterministic asynchronous consensus system can have at most two of the following three properties: safety (results are valid and identical at all nodes), guaranteed termination or liveness (nodes that don’t fail always produce a result), and fault tolerance (the system can survive the failure of one node at any point). This is a proven result. Any distributed consensus system on the Internet must sacrifice one of these features.
