# Brief History Of MITUM

* MITUM project was started in the spring of 2019
* The many ideas of MITUM was started from [SEBAK](https://github.com/bosnet/sebak), but MITUM was written from entirely scratch.
    - ISAAC consensus protocol
    - some of utilities
    - etc
* SEBAK project was started in the winter of 2017 by BlockchainOS with very smart guys
* At the biginning, MITUM tried to fill the missing things, such as,
    - several must-be features like multisig and contract
    - more efficient networking
    - simple and intuitive consensus protocol rather than ISAAC
* But MITUM will make it even more new
