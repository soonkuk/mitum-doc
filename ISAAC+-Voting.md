# Voting

ISAAC+ is based on PBFT, so every decision is made by voting. Voting messages is transfered by *ballot* seal in eash stages. In stages, the major agreed *ballot*s can be made to agreement by over threshold. Usually the threshold is decided when the network is started and never be changed.
