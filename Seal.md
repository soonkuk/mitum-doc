# Seal

All messages should be signed by sender, even client transaction also should be singed by account owner. MITUM use *Ed25519S* based keypair for signing and it is basically identical with [Stellar keypair](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/keypair).

The signed message, it is called *Seal*, it holds the message content.

By default, *Seal* has these informations,

* *Source* : signer address
* *Signature* : signature; generated by signer's private key with conjunction of *Network ID* and *hash* of *seal*.
* *SignedAt* : signed date time, it should be [*ISO8601*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

In MITUM there are several built-in seals,

## Consensus Related Seals

* *Proposal* : *proposer* will propose the transactions for next *block*
* *Ballot*s : votes for *Proposal* in each *stage*
    - *INITBallot*
    - *SIGNBallot*
    - *ACCEPTBallot*
* *Transaction*

## Block Related Seals

* *BlockProof* : When node tries to join node network and it requests the last blocks and it's proof to the nodes of Consensus Group.
