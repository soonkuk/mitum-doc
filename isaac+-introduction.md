# Consensus Protocol, ISAAC+

ISAAC+ is the consensus protocol, based on classic PBFT(Miguel Castro and Babara Liskov at 1999, [Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf)). ISAAC+ shares also the limitations of PBFT, but ISAAC+ will fill the hole by the engineering and achieves more finality with the goods of PBFT in decentralized way.
